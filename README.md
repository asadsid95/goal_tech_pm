1. Set up repo and project in Github
2. Set up database configuration in Flask app
3. ! Attempted to separate app creation and model created but I dont understand how application context works. This is also revealing my lack of understand of where and why extensions are initialized. \*This is to be revisited once MVP is created and the application needs to be structured better.
4. Im stuck at not knowing what happens at form submission time. Im not sure about the form element's attributes of method and action. Im also not sure how to point to another page after form submission
